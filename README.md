Project Background

CLI Food delivery service app created for Generation's Mini-project for the first 5 weeks of the Bootcamp. 



Client requirements
As of Week 4 of the project:

As a user I want to:
• create a product, courier, or order dictionary and add it to a list
• view all products, couriers, or orders
• update the status of an order
• persist my data
• STRETCH update or delete a product, order, or courier



How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?

As a whole, the design that I created could ultimately match the spirit of the projects requirements.
Each requirement needed to be met and tested thoroughly to match the final intended version of the product.
I planned and designed each requirement seperately and this allowed me to develop each feature individually and compounded them into the final product.



How did you guarantee the project's requirements?

I made certain that each project requirement was completed and its efficacy guaranteed through developing each requirement individually.
I also had to ensure that each requirement was easily testable, so that the user would be able to utilise the app without any errors.



If you had more time, what is one thing you would improve upon?

I would like to apply the usage of CSV files or JSON files to store the user data rather than a txt file to further follow the project requirements. However, I still am able to follow the project requirement of persistent data using txt files.
Other than that, I would also like to improve on my code by utilising Object Oriented Programming in order to implement more features to the app easily.

Additionally, If I could go back to the start, I would focus on implementing my code in a manner that would allow me to focus on setting up testing from the start. 
I would also like to create a database for the customer's details and utilise dictionaries and csv files to allow the user to update the status of the orders and add/change pricing for the different products.



What did you most enjoy implementing?

I enjoyed implementing the menu system the most, due to the simplicity of the implementation in order to give control to the user.
It utilises functions that can be called upon based on the user's inputs, which grew extensively as the project progressed.
